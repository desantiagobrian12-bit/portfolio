## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)

- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Content:** Case study copy in `docs/case-studies/*.md`; implemented in TSX pages under `src/app/case-studies/<slug>/page.tsx`
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Language:** TypeScript

## Project Structure

```

## Design Principles
1. **Clean and minimal** — Let the work speak for itself
2. **Fast and performant** — Static generation, optimized images
3. **Accessible** — Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels
4. **Responsive** — Mobile-first, works on all screen sizes
5. **Smooth interactions** — Subtle animations that enhance, not distract
6. **No emojis** — Never use emojis anywhere in the UI, copy, or code comments

## Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling (avoid inline styles or CSS modules)
- Use Framer Motion for animations (not CSS animations)
- Keep components small and focused
- Use semantic HTML elements (section, article, nav, main, etc.)
- All images must have alt text
- Use next/image for all images
- Use next/link for all internal links

## Content Context
- Case studies are in `/docs/case-studies/` — reference these for content
- Resume is in `/docs/resume.md`
- Portfolio brief is in `/docs/brief.md`
- Design references are in `/docs/design-references.md`

## Copy & Tone
- Professional but approachable. The portfolio should feel polished and confident without being cold or corporate.
- Avoid overusing em dashes (—). Use periods or commas instead. One em dash per paragraph max. Too many feel AI-generated.
- No emojis. Ever.
- Write like a human, not a copywriter. Keep it direct and natural.
