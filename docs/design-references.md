## Key Takeaways for My Portfolio

### From these references, I want:

1. **Metrics on case study cards** (like Nicole) — show impact before they click
2. **"What sets me apart" section** (like Dakota) — clear differentiators
3. **"How I use AI" section** (like Dakota & Yuri) — show my modern workflow
4. **Clean, light mode, product-like feel** (like Nicole & Dakota)
5. **Strong opening statement** (like Yuri & Tashfeen)
6. **Personal touch without overdoing it** (like Dakota — hobbies make you memorable)
7. **Outcome-focused project headlines** (like Richard — lead with the number)

### What I'm NOT doing:
- Not going as dark/playful as Tashfeen (my vibe is more minimal/clean)
- Not as many projects as Tashfeen (3 focused case studies > 9 projects)
- Not testimonials (yet — I can add these later when I collect them)
