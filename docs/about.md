# About Page Content

## Headline
Hey, I'm Brian.

## Bio

I studied Industrial Design at Tec de Monterrey. I was never the "creative kid." I was more of a formula person, following structures and systems. But at some point I realized that felt too easy, and I started forcing my mind to think differently. That shift changed everything. For years I didn't consider myself a creative person, and honestly, that tension between structure and creativity is what makes me the designer I am today.

I believe small things can have a big impact. In design, a tiny UX fix can change how thousands of people experience a product. In life, small decisions compound into something much bigger than you'd expect. That idea drives most of what I do.

I'm based in Guadalajara, Mexico. Great food, great culture, great people, and a growing tech scene that still has soul. I'm open to remote work worldwide, or to packing my bags and moving somewhere new.

Outside of work, I'm probably at a concert (house, jazz, or corridos tumbados, depending on the mood), at the gym, gaming, watching anime, or hunting for good food. I'm chill, easy to talk to, and I don't take myself too seriously.

## What Sets Me Apart

### Enterprise complexity is my comfort zone
Most designers want clean, greenfield projects. I thrive in messy environments — regulatory constraints, legacy systems, multiple stakeholders, business rules that don't fit neatly into a wireframe. I've designed for hemophilia medication logistics, enterprise AI platforms, and learning systems. The complexity is the interesting part.

### I design for AI — not just with it
I've designed GenAI conversational experiences at C3 AI — the kind where the AI's answer might be a paragraph, a data table, or a chart, and the interface needs to handle all of it. I understand the unique UX challenges of AI: trust, transparency, uncertainty, and making intelligent systems feel approachable.

### I think in decisions, not deliverables
I don't measure my work by how many screens I produced. I measure it by whether I made the right design decisions — and whether I can explain why. Every choice has a trade-off, and I'm intentional about which trade-offs I accept.

### I move fast without cutting corners
From POCs to v1.0s in 6-month cycles. From skipping wireframes to shipping high-fidelity prototypes that build client trust. I know when to be thorough and when to move. Speed and quality aren't opposites — they're a balance I've learned to navigate.

### I bridge design and technology
I use AI tools like Cursor, V0, and ChatGPT as part of my daily workflow. I vibecode my own portfolio. I'm not just designing for technical products — I understand the technology well enough to have meaningful conversations with engineers and make better design decisions because of it.

## How I Use AI

AI is part of how I work, not a replacement for thinking. Here's how I use it:

### Design exploration with V0
I use V0 to quickly generate and explore UI concepts — testing layout ideas, component variations, and visual directions faster than starting from scratch in Figma. It's a brainstorming accelerator, not a replacement for design judgment.

### Building with Cursor
I vibecode my own tools and portfolio using Cursor. It lets me go from design concept to working code faster, giving me a deeper understanding of what's feasible and how my designs translate to real implementation.

### ChatGPT as a thinking partner
I use ChatGPT to pressure-test my ideas — "what am I missing?", "what's the trade-off I'm not seeing?", "how would this work at scale?" It's like having a sparring partner available 24/7 for design thinking, content strategy, and research synthesis.

### Content and documentation
I use AI to draft, refine, and structure design documentation — user flows, case study narratives, handoff specs. It speeds up the writing without replacing the thinking behind it.

### My philosophy
AI makes me faster, not lazier. Every AI-generated output goes through my judgment — I evaluate, refine, and take ownership of the final result. The tool doesn't make the decision; I do.

## How I Work

**Start with the user.** I don't design from assumptions. I start by understanding the real problem — who's affected, what they're trying to do, and what's getting in the way.

**Think in systems.** I look for patterns and scalable solutions. A good design decision shouldn't just solve one screen — it should make the next 10 screens easier.

**Ship, then refine.** I'd rather ship something good and iterate than polish something perfect that never launches. Fast feedback beats slow perfection.

**Stay curious.** Every project teaches me something new — whether it's healthcare logistics, generative AI, or how people learn. I enjoy the learning as much as the designing.
