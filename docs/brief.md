# Portfolio Brief

## About Me

**Name:** Brian Francisco De Santiago Palomera
**Role:** Product Designer
**Location:** Guadalajara, Mexico (Open to remote)
**Experience:** 2.5 years in enterprise and B2B products

**One-liner:**
"I design clarity within complexity — translating intricate business and operational challenges into seamless user experiences."

**Bio:**
I'm a Product Designer who enjoys working on complex systems and turning them into experiences that actually make sense for people. Most of my work lives in enterprise and operational environments, where business rules, constraints, and real-world processes can get messy fast. I like bringing structure to that chaos — balancing user needs, business goals, and technical realities to create products that feel simple, even when they're not.
